### About the dev gateway

[The dev gateway](https://dev.gateway.storyform.xyz/) proxies requests to a Bundlr node at devnet.bundlr.network, which is a node in the [Bundlr Devnet](https://docs.bundlr.network/docs/devnet). Please note that contents uploaded to the Bundlr Devnet are cleared after a week.
